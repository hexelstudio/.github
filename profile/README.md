**Hexel Studio builds production-grade autonomous AI systems.**  
Not demos. Not prompt experiments. Not fragile workflows.

We design and operate **agent-native infrastructure** and **end-to-end autonomous systems** that execute real business work with reliability, auditability, and scale.

Our focus is where AI actually breaks: long-running execution, coordination, observability, and governance.

## What Hexel Studio Is

Hexel Studio is an **AI systems engineering company**.

We build infrastructure and autonomous agents that:
- Run **stateful, long-lived workflows**
- Execute deterministically under policy control
- Operate across cloud and hybrid environments
- Produce full audit trails for every action

These systems are designed to run **24/7 in production**, not in notebooks or demos.

---

## What We Build

### Agent Infrastructure
Core runtime, orchestration, and observability layers for operating autonomous agents in production.

Includes:
- Deterministic agent execution engines
- Secure tool and action sandboxes
- Policy-driven control planes
- End-to-end observability and audit logs
- Failure handling and recovery

---

### Vertical Autonomous Systems
Purpose-built agent systems for complex enterprise workflows, including:
- Compliance and audit operations
- Knowledge and research automation
- Internal tools and operational workflows
- Multi-step decision and execution pipelines

These systems **replace manual work**, not just assist it.

---

### Agent Cloud & Deployment Platform
A managed environment to deploy, govern, and scale agent-based systems across organizations.

Designed for:
- Multi-tenant operation
- Strong isolation and security boundaries
- Governance, permissions, and cost visibility
- Enterprise-grade reliability

---

## How We Think

Our architecture is guided by a few non-negotiable principles:

- **Control ≠ Execution**  
- **Agents ≠ Services**  
- **Infrastructure is replaceable**  
- **Everything is observable**  
- **Every action is auditable**  
- **Reliability beats novelty**

If a system cannot be inspected, reasoned about, and trusted — it is not production-ready.

---

## Who This Is For

Hexel Studio works with:
- Teams building serious AI products
- Enterprises automating real operational workflows
- Founders deploying AI systems that must not fail silently

If you are experimenting, prototyping, or chasing demos — this is not for you.  
If you are deploying AI to **run parts of your business**, we should talk.

---

## In One Line

**Hexel Studio builds AI systems that do work — reliably, repeatedly, and at scale.**

---

## Status

Hexel Studio is actively building and deploying autonomous systems in production.  
Select components and documentation will be open-sourced as they mature.
