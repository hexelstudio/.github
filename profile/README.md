# Hexel Studio

Hexel Studio is a platform for designing, orchestrating, and deploying AI-native systems powered by autonomous agents. It provides a unified foundation for building complex automation workflows without stitching together fragmented tools or relying on brittle, ad-hoc integrations.

Hexel agents are modular, tool-enabled, and capable of coordinating through structured messages. This enables the creation of workflows that are resilient, extensible, and maintainable — from single-agent tasks to distributed multi-agent systems.

## Core Principles

- **Modularity** — agents, tools, memory, and orchestration are cleanly separated.  
- **Extensibility** — integrate APIs, connectors, databases, vector stores, or custom tools.  
- **Reliability** — built-in governance, observability, logging, isolation, and retries.  
- **Scalability** — run agents locally, in containers, or across cloud and edge environments.

Hexel Studio aims to standardize how AI systems are engineered by providing a coherent, production-ready architecture for agentic applications.

**A structured operating layer for the agent-driven future.**
