# 🚀 Hexel Studio

**Hexel Studio** is a modular platform for building, deploying, and scaling AI-native workflows using autonomous agents. Designed for developers, researchers, and teams, Hexel lets you automate complex tasks with collaborative, no-boilerplate agents — all with modern tooling and full extensibility.

> Build AI workflows that actually ship. No monoliths. No Frankenstein stacks. Just agents that work together.

## 🧠 What is Hexel Studio?

Hexel Studio is a flexible framework for designing and orchestrating **AI agents** capable of:

- 🔄 **Automating multi-step workflows**
- 🧩 **Composing with APIs, tools, or internal logic**
- 📡 **Collaborating with each other in a visual or programmatic canvas**
- ⚙️ **Deploying across environments (cloud, local, edge, or hybrid)**

Think of it as an OS for AI-native systems — one built to empower teams who are serious about production-level AI.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Agent-Based Architecture**  
  Each agent is modular, observable, and can be connected to others through simple logic or code.

- **Visual Flow Builder**  
  Design workflows using a drag-and-drop interface — great for prototyping and collaboration.

- **SDKs & API-First Design**  
  Integrate agents into your product, pipelines, or tools with minimal overhead.

- **Agent Marketplace**  
  Use or remix community and enterprise-grade agents to accelerate your builds.

- **Built-In Dev Tools**  
  Versioning, analytics, experiment tracking, and live testing built-in.

- **Cloud-Native & Extensible**  
  Works with any backend — bring your own models, vector DBs, APIs, or infra.
